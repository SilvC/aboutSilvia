I am Silvia Chilel. My friend would describe me as involved, committed, and always open to new things. I always finish what I start. It is true that I am committed, but I am also very hospitable and determined to meet my goals. I feel like I've worked hard to get here, and I will continue to work harder to get farther. Although I am a bad test taker, considering my ACT score, I am working hard to get a 26. I always motivate myself to do better, so I believe that is one of my best qualities. 
        I've always been very shy. Thus, freshman year I pushed myself to get out of my comfort zone. I joined the girls rugby team, the drill team, and I've been participating in various summer programs. I've grown so much as a person, student, and professional. Through my involvement in these activities, my confidence has grown immensely. 
       This summer, I am participating in a coding program for Girls Who Code. I am really excited for that. My school does not offer technology programs, so I took an initiative to apply to this program. I am looking forward to find out if Computer Science is a career path for me, which I think is likely. 
      Prior to graduation I hope to become the best leader I can be. I hope to have a great season with the girl's rugby team. In addition, I would like to keep developing my leadership skills through the MCJROTC program. Academically, I would like to continue getting good grades, no Cs. I am really excited to take AP physics and AP calculus this year. I hope to do well on the AP tests. 
    After high school, I hope to get into the school of my dream: University of Michigan. My college counselors nominated me as a posse scholar, so I hope to earn the scholarship. Michigan's STEM program is what really attracts me to the school. Hopefully, after high school, I will be an alumn at the University of Michigan.
